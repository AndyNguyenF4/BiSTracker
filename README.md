# BiS Tracker

BiS Tracker is a Dalamud plugin for Final Fantasy XIV that helps players easily track their Best-in-Slot (BiS) gear progress directly in-game. It supports imports from Etro.gg and XIVGear.app, then displays what you own and what you’re missing with clear color-coding and an integrated currency tracker.

* Features
  *  Color-Coded Items - Quickly see which items you own, still need to upgrade, or don't have.
  *  Currency Tracker - Track how many books and tomes you currently have, as well as how much you'll need for the remaining set.
  *  BiS Imports - Supports importing gearsets directly from [Etro.gg](https://etro.gg/) and [XIVGear.app](https://xivgear.app/)
